PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Organizing events is an important aspect of life that helps create unforgettable memories. Each event has its unique story, making it necessary to make it special. EventPros is a company that offers a one-stop solution for customers who want to book event spaces by combining event management with Airbnb bookings. We assist customers in selecting the perfect space based on their event type, number of guests, and preferences. Our services are currently only available within the five boroughs of New York City.

We can assist customers in planning various events, such as birthday parties, receptions, reunions, baby showers, graduation parties, dance parties, weddings, bridal photoshoots, job fairs, mixers, meetups, memorials, seminars, focus groups, improv sessions, workshops, or coaching sessions, retreats, screenings, recitals, live music events, dance or yoga sessions, or film shooting. We can help customers organize any event they have in mind; they only need to tell us their requirements, and we'll handle the rest, from booking the venue to purchasing event tickets.

Our customer base is diverse and includes anyone who wishes to host an event, whether it's an organization, a family, or a small group of college friends. Our goal is to simplify the event planning process by integrating event management and space procurement, which is unique to our business. In the long run, we plan to create our all-inclusive platform that lists available properties for all types of events and provides various search filters. Customers will need to provide information about their event type, property type preference, location preference, guest list size, and so on. We'll then offer recommendations, and customers can choose one or suggest something else. Once the space is finalized, customers can select from our list of packages, and we'll plan and execute the event from start to finish. Our end-to-end solution allows customers to focus on the day and their guests.
